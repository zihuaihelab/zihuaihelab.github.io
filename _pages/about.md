Recent advances in genome sequencing and imputation technologies provide an exciting opportunity to study the contribution of genetic variants to disease phenotypes, but our ability to explain heritability and to translate genetic risk into mechanistic insight remains limited at this point. In our recent paper that can be found [here](https://google.com), we propose a multiple knockoffs inference to enhance the discovery of genome-wide association studies (GWAS), by improving its statistical power for locus discovery and its resolution at each locus to prioritize the putative causal variants. 

Our Software nicknamed "GhostKnockoff" is free to use and publicly available. The [GitHub](https://sosaar@github.com) has all pertinent code and dependencies and further information about its context, use, and communication with authors is on this page. 

About
======
We develop a method to perform knockoff-based inference without generating any individual-level knockoffs. The method requires only summary statistics (Z-score) from conventional GWAS and retains useful features of knockoff-based inference. The method additionally allows meta-analysis of studies with arbitrary sample overlapping. It is also robust to genetic variants that do not show up in all studies, and therefore applicable to the integration of genetic association studies genotyped using SNP-array, whole exome-sequencing and whole genome sequencing.
